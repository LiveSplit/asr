//! Helper crate to write auto splitters for LiveSplit One's auto splitting
//! runtime.
//!
//! There are two ways of defining an auto splitter.
//!
//! # Defining an `update` function
//!
//! You can define an `update` function that will be called every frame. This is
//! the simplest way to define an auto splitter. The function must have the
//! following signature:
//! ```no_run
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn update() {}
//! ```
//!
//! The advantage of this approach is that you have full control over what
//! happens on every tick of the runtime. However, it's much harder to keep
//! state around as you need to store all state in global variables as you need
//! to return out of the function on every tick.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use asr::Process;
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn update() {
//!     if let Some(process) = Process::attach("explorer.exe") {
//!         asr::print_message("Hello World!");
//!         if let Ok(address) = process.get_module_address("explorer.exe") {
//!             if let Ok(value) = process.read::<u32>(address) {
//!                 if value > 0 {
//!                     asr::timer::start();
//!                 }
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Defining an asynchronous `main` function
//!
//! You can use the [`async_main`] macro to define an asynchronous `main`
//! function.
//!
//! Similar to using an `update` function, it is important to constantly yield
//! back to the runtime to communicate that the auto splitter is still alive.
//! All asynchronous code that you await automatically yields back to the
//! runtime. However, if you want to write synchronous code, such as the main
//! loop handling of a process on every tick, you can use the
//! [`next_tick`](future::next_tick) function to yield back to the runtime and
//! continue on the next tick.
//!
//! The main low level abstraction is the [`retry`](future::retry) function,
//! which wraps any code that you want to retry until it succeeds, yielding back
//! to the runtime between each try.
//!
//! So if you wanted to attach to a Process you could for example write:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use asr::{Process, future::retry};
//! # async fn example() {
//! let process = retry(|| Process::attach("MyGame.exe")).await;
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This will try to attach to the process every tick until it succeeds. This
//! specific example is exactly how the [`Process::wait_attach`] method is
//! implemented. So if you wanted to attach to any of multiple processes, you
//! could for example write:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use asr::{Process, future::retry};
//! # async fn example() {
//! let process = retry(|| {
//!    ["a.exe", "b.exe"].into_iter().find_map(Process::attach)
//! }).await;
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here is a full example of how an auto splitter could look like using the
//! [`async_main`] macro:
//!
//! Usage on stable Rust:
//! ```ignore
//! async_main!(stable);
//! ```
//!
//! Usage on nightly Rust:
//! ```ignore
//! #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait, const_async_blocks)]
//!
//! async_main!(nightly);
//! ```
//!
//! The asynchronous main function itself:
//! ```ignore
//! async fn main() {
//!     // TODO: Set up some general state and settings.
//!     loop {
//!         let process = Process::wait_attach("explorer.exe").await;
//!         process.until_closes(async {
//!             // TODO: Load some initial information from the process.
//!             loop {
//!                 // TODO: Do something on every tick.
//!                next_tick().await;
//!             }
//!         }).await;
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
